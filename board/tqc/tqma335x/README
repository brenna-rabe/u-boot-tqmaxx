U-Boot for TQ-Systems GmbH TQMa335x modules

This file contains information for the port of
U-Boot to the TQ-Systems TQMa335x[L] modules.

Note: 

- <x> is a placeholder for the exact CPU variant
- TQMa335x is the click on variant of the SOM, TQMa335xL is the
  solder on / LGA variant of the SOM

As of now, all CPU variants and both SOM variants share the same bootloader
configuration.

1. Boot sources
--------------

The following boot sources are supported:

- SD
- e-MMC

In the default configuration MLO (aka SPL) is expected in a FAT patition on the boot media.
The U-Boot 'proper' image is loaded from the very same partition.


2. Building
-----------

To build U-Boot for the TQ-Systems TQMa335x[L] modules:

	export CROSS_COMPILE=
	export ARCH=arm
	make tqma57xx_<mem>_<baseboard>_config
	make

Currently implemented baseboards:

- mba335x (MBa335x Starterkit Mainboard)

Currently implemented memory variants:

- 256mb (256 MiB DDR3)
- 512mb (512 MiB DDR3)


This gives the following configurations:

tqma335x_256mb_mba335x_config
tqma335x_512mb_mba335x_config
